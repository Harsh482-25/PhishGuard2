# PhishGuard2
In this modern computarized world, phishing attacks have become a major cybersecurity threat where attackers use deceptive emails or messages to steal sensitive information such as credit card details. And many people find it difficult to differentiate between phishing and non-phishing attacks, which makes them a victim of cybercrimes.
And thatâ€™s why we, CodeSphere, introduce you to Phishing Awareness Training Game- Spot the Fish-  where individuals can train themselves in identifying attempts at phishing.

The solution we developed is an interactive training game through which real-world phishing scenarios are simulated. In the game, users are shown emails, messages or links and they need to analyse and decide if it is a phishing attempt or not.
It is point-based system game with immediate feedback mechanism and multiple levels with increasing difficulty. This promotes the user's engagement and also increases their knowledge retention while keeping them motivated throughout their journey.
